# Overall idea
In order to expedite the process of generating and positioning various mechanical components, including gears, in my Maya scene, I have developed a script utilizing Python. This script consists of two main parts: a modeling component and a Python script component. The primary function of this script is to generate random models from a specified modeling file and randomly position them within the scene. This script allows me to efficiently create and place these elements in a randomized manner, ultimately saving time and effort in my workflows.

# where to use
In my Maya project, the main scene depicts a corner of an abandoned kitchen. Within this scene, there are numerous abandoned mechanical components scattered across the table, floor, and shelves. To create these components and position them in a realistic and varied manner, I use my script that randomly places them within a designated area within the scene.
